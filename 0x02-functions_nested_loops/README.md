## 📝 List of Programs

### Basic Programs
1. [🖋️ \_putchar](./0-putchar.c): A program that prints the word "\_putchar" followed by a newline.
2. [🔤 Print Alphabet](./1-alphabet.c): A function that prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a newline.
3. [🔤 Print Alphabet x10](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c): A function that prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each followed by a newline.
4. [🔡 Check for Lowercase](./3-islower.c): A function that checks if a character is lowercase and returns 1 if it is, or 0 if it isn't.
5. [🔤🔡 Check for Alphabetic](./4-isalpha.c): A function that checks if a character is alphabetic (either lowercase or uppercase) and returns 1 if it is, or 0 if it isn't.
6. [➕🔢 Print Sign](./5-sign.c): A function that prints the sign of a number (+, 0, or -) and returns 1 if the number is greater than zero, 0 if it's zero, and -1 if it's less than zero.
7. [🔢 Compute Absolute Value](./6-abs.c): A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. [🔢 Print Last Digit](./7-print_last_digit.c): A function that prints and returns the last digit of a number.
9. [⏰ Jack Bauer's Hours](./8-24_hours.c): A function that prints every minute of the day in the format "HH:MM."

### Intermediate Programs
10. [📊 Print Times Table](./9-times_table.c): A function that prints the 9 times table, formatted as shown.
11. [➕ Add Two Integers](./10-add.c): A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. [🔢 Print to 98](./11-print_to_98.c): A function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.
13. [📊 Print Times Table (Advanced)](./100-times_table.c): A function that prints the n times table, starting with 0, with certain constraints.
14. [Σ Sum of Multiples](./101-natural.c): A program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
15. [🔢 Print Fibonacci Numbers](./102-fibonacci.c): A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
16. [Σ Even Fibonacci Sum](./103-fibonacci.c): A program that finds and prints the sum of even-valued Fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000.
17. [🔢 Print Fibonacci Numbers (Advanced)](./104-fibonacci.c): A program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers with certain constraints.
