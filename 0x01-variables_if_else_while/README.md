## üìù Tasks

### Positive Anything is Better than Negative Nothing

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

### The Last Digit

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`.

### I Sometimes Suffer from Insomnia...

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.

### AlphABET

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase using only the `putchar` function.

### Numbers

Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

### Numberz

Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, without using variables of type `char`.

### Smile in the Mirror

Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using only the `putchar` function.

### Hexadecimal

Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase.

### Patience, Persistence, and Perspiration

Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

### The Success Combination in Business

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### The Success Combination in Business (Advanced)

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

### Software is Eating the World

Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

## üìã Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- No errors or warnings during compilation
- Code should follow the Betty style

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the task you want to run.
3. Compile the C file using `gcc`.
4. Run the compiled program.

Example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o positive_or_negative
./positive_or_negative
